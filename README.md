# Local-Hack-Day-Build-a-Discord-Bot
This documentation demonstrates building a discord bot that is hosted on replit.com built using Python's discord library.
The Bot takes command $inspire and sends out random inspirational quotes from the 𝐳𝐞𝐧𝐪𝐮𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬.𝐢𝐨 API. 
The development for the bot is also done on replit.com.
https://replit.com/ actually ends up saving a lot of time and resources since installation of packages to development can all be done online.
